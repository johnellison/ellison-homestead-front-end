        <h3>Open House</h3>
        <p>
          This spring we'll be holding an open house to welcome the local community into our homestead to celebrate the start of a new growing season and a new family in the area. There will be a free barbeque with plenty to go around. If you're planning on coming, please bring some drinks and sides to share.

        <h3>Spring Kick-off Workshop</h3>
        <p>
          If you're interested in living on the land in community with others, please feel free to attend our spring kick-off workshop. We'll be hosting a local charity called New Routes that provides integration support for asylum seekers in Norwich. Following in the tradition of The Grange, we'll have a weekly volunteer day every Wednesday throughout 2017.
