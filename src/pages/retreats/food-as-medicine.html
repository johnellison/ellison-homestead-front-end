        <h3>Retreat Experience</h3>
        <p>
          Going away can be a big hassle for anyone, let alone for people who struggle with health conditions. We've designed our entire retreat experience with the needs of our guests as the guiding force. From the registration process all the way through to the moment you leave, we've sought after every tiny detail to help make your stay as comfortable and enjoyable as possible. We encourage all of our residents to keep a daily journal of their retreat experience.

        <h3>Organic Food</h3>
        <p>
          High-nutrient organic food is one of the most important aspects of the functional medicine protocol for people with auto-immune disorders. That's why we grow as much as we can ourselves. We buy organic heirloom variety seeds from specialty producers; we sow the seeds and cultivate the soil ourselves. You wouldn't believe what a difference it makes in the taste too.

        <h3>Physical Therapy</h3>
        <p>
          Physical therapy is the other main component of the auto-immune protocol. Specialised therapists meet with you to assess the best routine during your stay, and then help you through your daily exercises. Activities range from simple swim strokes all the way to electrical muscle stimulation, depending on the situation. You can learn more about our approach and our practitioners here.

        <h3>Workshops &amp; Education</h3>
        <p>
          We want to help you make the lifestyle changes necessary to continue experiencing the benefits of the retreat long after your stay, so we hold small and intimate workshops for those who are able to attend&mdash;often around a kitchen table or other comfortable setting. Our aim is to empower our guests to take their health into their own hands. You'll leave with meal plans, grocery shopping lists, physical therapy exercises and a strong understanding of how each component fits into your healing and recovery.

        <h3>Nutrition</h3>
        <p>
          After experimenting with several auto-immune protocols as a family, we've arrived at a wealth of different nutritional approaches. We work with certified functional doctors to develop a specialised nutritional plan specifically for you and create a meal plan while you stay and after you leave. Questions are welcomed and encouraged because we want all of our guests to understand <em>why</em> and <em>how</em> nutrition plays such a key role in treating auto-immunity.

        <h3>Accommodation</h3>
        <p>
          We've designed and built independent chalets specifically for our Food as Medicine guests. Each structure is fully accessible, suitable for one person or a couple and is free of the toxic chemicals often found in modern buildings which can trigger the immune system. Each chalet has been constructed to maximize its connection to nature. So whether you're waking up to the soft morning light and sound of the birds, or having an evening drink beneath the warm sunset&mdash;you'll feel the rest and relaxation you deserve to experience on a retreat.

        <h3>Ongoing Support</h3>
        <p>
          We know how hard it can be to making lasting lifestyle changes for the betterment of your health. Adopting an auto-immune protocol and a daily physical therapy routine can be tricky and sometimes frustrating. Since we've been through it ourselves we decided to provide optional ongoing support in the form of remote video conferences with certified functional doctors and nutritionists. You can inquire about a support plan ahead of time, or after your stay. It's entirely up to you. We just want to be here for you if you need us.
