          <h3>Retreat Experience</h3>
          <p>
            Going away can be a big hassle for anyone, let alone for people who struggle with their health. We've designed our entire retreat experience with the needs of our guests as the guiding force. From the registration process all the way through to the moment you leave, we've sought after every tiny detail to help make your stay as comfortable and enjoyable as possible. We encourage all of our residents to keep a daily journal of their retreat experience.

          <h3>Organic Food</h3>
          <p>
            High-nutrient organic food is one of the most important aspects of the functional medicine protocol for people with auto-immune disorders. That's why we grow as much as we can ourselves. We buy organic heirloom variety seeds from specialty producers; we sow the seeds and cultivate the soil ourselves. You wouldn't believe what a difference it makes in the taste too.

          <h3>Physical Therapy</h3>
          <p>
            Physical therapy is the other main component of the auto-immune protocol. Specialised therapists meet with you to assess the best routine during your stay, and then help you through your daily exercises. Activities range from simple swim strokes all the way to electrical muscle stimulation, depending on the situation. You can learn more about our approach and our practitioners here.
